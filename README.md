This is a docker/react project that was made with help from the React quickstart feature(s).

To successfully run this application, make sure you have docker installed. Having docker engine installed can also simplify and help visualize what is happening.

1) Run 'npm start'
2) Open http://localhost:3000 on your browser
3) Run 'npm test'
4) Run 'npm run build'
5) Build should be up and running and be able to be viewed on your browser, and using 'docker ps' you can see the container in action
6) OPTIONAL: Run 'npm run eject' (WARNING! this command is irreversible)

Once you are up and running the browser page should automatically reload once a change is detected through Travis CI.
